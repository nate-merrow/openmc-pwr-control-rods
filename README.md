## About

This is definitely my most extensive project to date and took quite a bit of effort to finally get working correctly. The main script of this file (PWR_control_rods.py) includes a relatively extensive
geometry section that that defines a roughly 63 cm x 63 cm x 120 cm pressurized water reactor (PWR) that includes both partially and fully inserted boron carbide control rods. In the four corner assemblies,
the control rods are two-thirds of the way inserted (80/120 cm) in a 5 x 5 array spread out through the 17 x 17 assembly, and in the center assembly, they are fully inserted. In the other four assemblies,
only light water rods serving as moderator sit in those lattice positions. The effects of the control rods are clearly visible in the radial power and flux plots located in the output file.
Overall, I'm quite proud of getting this to work!

## What Next?

Given my extensive geometry defintions, I could pretty easily switch around or change the control rod depths, leading to different effects that I may analyze and compare down the line.
